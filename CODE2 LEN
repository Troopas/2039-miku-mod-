<p>It's absolutely inconceivable. You have won every single state, except one. For decades, your campaign will be studied. What once was believed to be a troubled campaign ran by an outsider with no political knowledge, to having to respond to an economic crisis of your own party's creation, to finally win and in a landslide no less? It is quite something. You probably won't have to fear running for re-election, if you choose to. Even the midterms will almost certainly result in a fine enough Congress. Congratulations madam President, let's get to work.</p>

NOTE: For the time being, you can access this ending if you obtain 535 or more electoral votes. There will be a different one in the future for obtaining however many electoral votes, so if you didn't achieve exactly 535 electoral votes as it says in this ending, don't worry about it.`;

<p>Congratulations! Despite the fierce 3rd party challenger, and failures of the current Democratic President, you have beaten the odds and defeat Kasane Teto and Akita Neru to become President. Although you have won comfortably, don't be fooled. The midterms will certainly be a wake up call for Democrats, after 10 years of rule.

You have won the 2039 Presidential Election!\n</font>\n\n<p>It's absolutely inconceivable. You have won every single state, except one. For decades, your campaign will be studied. What once was believed to be a troubled campaign ran by an outsider with no political knowledge, to having to respond to an economic crisis of your own party's creation, to finally win and in a landslide no less? It is quite something. You probably won't have to fear running for re-election, if you choose to. Even the midterms will almost certainly result in a fine enough Congress. Congratulations madam President, let's get to work.</p>\n<br>\nNOTE: For the time being, you can access this ending if you obtain 535 or more electoral votes. There will be a different one in the future for obtaining however many electoral votes, so if you didn't achieve exactly 535 electoral votes as it says in this ending, don't worry about it.",
